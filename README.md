# 🛠️ Compiler from Scratch

This repository contains my custom implementation of a simplified C compiler (not Turing complete), developed in four key stages:

1. **Symbol Table** – A foundational data structure to store identifiers and their attributes.
2. **Lexical Analyzer** – Tokenizes input source code into meaningful symbols.
3. **Parser** – Constructs the syntax tree by analyzing token sequences using grammar rules.
4. **Intermediate Code Generator (ICG)** – Translates parsed code into x86 (8086) assembly instructions.
